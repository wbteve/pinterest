	<h1>
		Files Pane
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Files Pane lists all files available in the selected folder.</p>
	<h2>
		Different Views</h2>
	<p>
		The Files Pane may present two different views, depending on CKFinder settings (see
		"<a href="008.html">Settings</a>"). The following is a comparison of the "<strong>Thumbnails</strong>"
		and the "<strong>List</strong>" views for the same folder:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="images/007.gif" width="404" height="332" />
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="images/006.gif" width="404" height="332" />
	</p>
	<h2>
		Basic Operations &nbsp;</h2>
	<h3>
		Selecting (Activating) a File</h3>
	<p>
		To select a file, making it the "active file" in CKFinder, simply click in the file.
		To make it easy to understand that the mouse is over the file, the file area will
		be colored. The selected file will have a different background color (generally
		blue).
	</p>
	<h2>
		Advanced Operations
	</h2>
	<p>
		Advanced operations may be achieved on a file by using its "<a href="012.html">Context
			Menu</a>". The following options are available:

		on CKFinder settings enforced by your system administrator.

			Selecting Files
		</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		To select a file, returning it to the hosting application, just click the "Select"
		option.</p>
	<h3>
		Viewing (previewing) Files</h3>
	<p>
		To preview a file in the browser, just click the "View" button. Not all kinds of
		files can be viewed on browsers, but this feature is quite useful for images, text
		and PDF files. In other cases, the browser will ask you to open the file with the
		proper application.</p>
	<div>
		<h3>
			Downloading Files</h3>
		<p>
			To download a file, just click the "Download" button. The browser will ask you for
			the place to save the downloaded file in your computer.</p>
		<h3>
			Renaming Files
		</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		To rename a file, just click the "Rename" option in the context menu. A dialog box,
		containing the current file name, will appear, asking for the new name. Just type
		it and confirm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not all characters can be used in folder and files names due to limitations in the
		systems where CKFinder runs. For instance, the following characters cannot be used
		on folders and files names: <strong>\</strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong>:</strong>
		<strong>*</strong> <strong>?</strong> <strong>"</strong> <strong>&lt;</strong> <strong>
			&gt;</strong> <strong>|</strong></p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> by renaming a file, links or media insertions
		available in other pages, which point to the renamed file, will be "broken", therefore
		not available anymore. So, be careful when using this feature.</p>
	<div>
		<h3>
			Deleting Files
		</h3>
	</div>
	<p>
		To delete a file, just click the "Delete" option in the context menu. A confirmation
		message will appear to ensure that this operation is desired.
