		Upload Button
	</h1>
	<p>
		The upload* button, in the <a href="005.html">toolbar</a>, opens the "Upload Pane",
		which can be used to add new files to the current folder. Here is a screenshot of
		it:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img height="153" src="images/012.gif" width="404" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		To close the Upload Pane, just click in the "Cancel" button, or click "Upload" again
		in the toolbar.</p>
	<p>
		* "<strong>Upload</strong>" is a technical term. It means the action of transferring
		a file from your local computer to a central computer (also known as server).</p>
	<h2>
		Upload Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Select the file from your computer by using the "Browse..." button. The text in
			the button may vary from browsers, but it will always be right after the "Select
			the file to upload" field.</li>
		<li>Click the "Upload Selected File" button. A message will appear, indicating that
			the upload is in progress.</li>
		<li>Wait for the upload to terminate. Once completed, the Upload Pane will close automatically,
			and the uploaded file will be selected in the <a href="004.html">Files Pane</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>
		Upload Messages</h2>
	<p>
		The following are messages that may appear when uploading files:</p>
	<h3>
		A file with the same name is already available. The uploaded file has been renamed
		to "filename(1).ext"</h3>
	<p>
		Indicates that the uploaded file name is already in use by another
		file in the same folder. To avoid conflict, a progressive number, the "(1)", has
		been appended to the original name.</p>
	<h3>
		Invalid file</h3>
	<p>
		The uploaded file has not been accepted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The most common cause for this messages is that CKFinder has been configured to
		not accept the kind of file you are trying to upload, based on its extension. This
		is a security restriction. Another cause of it may be that the file size is too
		big for your system. In this case the server must be configured to accept bigger
		files.
	</p>
	<h3>Upload cancelled for security reasons. The file contains HTML like data.</h3>
	<p>The uploaded file contains HTML code. For security reasons, only files with selected extensions are allowed to contain HTML code.</p>

	<p>
		Please contact your system administrator to have more information regarding the
		accepted file types and their size limits.</p>
