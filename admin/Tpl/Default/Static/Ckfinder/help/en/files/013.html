		making it easy to deploy and to use in any computer.</p>
	<p>
		Currently, the following browsers are required to CKFinder to run:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Internet Explorer 6.0+</li>
		<li>Firefox 2.0+</li>
		<li>Safari 3+</li>

		Some features are dependent of your browser settings. By default, it should be ready
		for CKFinder, but if you are experiencing problems with the <a href="012.html">Context
			Menu</a> or your <a href="008.html">Settings</a> are not being saved, be sure
		that your browser is configured to "<strong>allow scripts to replace context menus</strong>" ("allow scripts to receive right clicks")
		and that you have "<strong>cookies support enabled</strong>".</p>
	<p>
		Please contact your system administrator if you have any doubt.</p>
